# Gap Notes — fr13_dashboard

## 2026-07-06 — Phase 1 self-critique (per user checklist)

Re-reading `output/01_Requirements_Breakdown.md` against
`input/Functional_Requirement.md` before approval. Findings only — nothing
fixed yet. Each finding tagged `[P1-Gxx]` with evidence and an honest
severity call (real gap vs. nitpick).

### 1. Atomicity — any REQ merging two independently-testable rules?

On the two examples the user specifically flagged:
- **PASS** — delivered-inclusion (REQ-05) and other-status-exclusion (REQ-06)
  are already split into two separate REQs, not merged.
- **PASS** — valid-JWT-required (REQ-08) and role-must-be-admin (REQ-09) are
  already split into two separate REQs, not merged.

But two *other* atomicity issues exist that weren't named in the prompt's
examples:

- **[P1-G01] real gap** — REQ-08 and REQ-09 each state "the dashboard **and**
  its underlying admin APIs" as a single combined access surface (inherited
  verbatim from §3.3's own phrasing). This conflates two potentially distinct
  surfaces — a frontend dashboard route vs. the `/api/admin/*` endpoints —
  into one MUST statement. If the two surfaces enforce access differently
  (e.g. the API correctly returns 401/403 but a client-side-only dashboard
  route doesn't re-check role, or vice versa), neither REQ-08 nor REQ-09 can
  attribute the failure to a single surface. Evidence: REQ-08, REQ-09
  statements in `01_Requirements_Breakdown.md`.
- **[P1-G02] real gap** — REQ-08 ("valid JWT required") does not split "no
  token" vs. "invalid/malformed token" into separate atomic sub-conditions.
  This project's own FR-11 precedent split exactly this distinction into
  REQ-16/REQ-17 for the same reason (a bug affecting only one condition
  should stay distinguishable at the requirement level). Evidence: REQ-08
  statement; contrast with `fr11_order_history_view/output/01_Requirements_Breakdown.md`
  REQ-16/REQ-17.

### 2. Any REQ inferred beyond the spec? Quote check per REQ

Quotes verified as direct/accurate for: REQ-01, REQ-03, REQ-04, REQ-05,
REQ-06, REQ-07, REQ-09, REQ-10, REQ-11, REQ-12, REQ-13. Two issues found:

- **[P1-G03] real gap** — REQ-08's Source Reference cites "§3.3 ...
  (JWT-presence clause, per FR-12)", but the literal §3.3 bullet 1 text is
  "The dashboard and its underlying admin APIs MUST be accessible only to
  accounts with `role = 'admin'`" — that sentence is about the **role**
  requirement, not JWT presence/validity. The parenthetical "(JWT-presence
  clause, per FR-12)" is my own inferential label, not a quote of FR-13 text.
  The actual direct textual support for "a valid JWT is required" is §5:
  "No token / invalid token: access denied." — which was never cited. This
  contradicts the artifact's own Self-Check claim that "each REQ row cites
  the exact section/quote" (Self-Check item 1). Evidence: REQ-08 Source
  Reference cell vs. §3.3/§5 text in `input/Functional_Requirement.md`.
- **[P1-G04] nitpick** — REQ-14's statement adds an interpretive clause
  ("meaning the value summed into revenue (REQ-05) may rest on a
  client-controlled number rather than a backend-verified one") beyond a
  literal restatement of the §7 bullet. This is a reasonable analytical
  bridge, not an invented business rule or threshold, so severity is low —
  but it is inference layered on the quote, not the quote itself. Evidence:
  REQ-14 vs. §7 "total_amount trustworthiness" bullet.
- **[P1-G05] nitpick** — REQ-02 bundles three distinct facts (endpoint path,
  request body shape, the 5-value status enum) into one row. Lower severity
  since REQ-02 is tagged Observation, not a testable FR-13 business rule.
  Evidence: REQ-02 vs. §2.

### 3. Is the exclusion rule its own REQ, or only implied inside inclusion?

**PASS** — REQ-06 ("Orders whose status is pending/confirmed/shipping/
canceled MUST NOT contribute to total revenue") is a fully separate row from
REQ-05 (inclusion), not folded into it or left implicit. This matches the
user's original special instruction 1.

### 4. Does access control cover admin / valid-but-non-admin / no-or-invalid-token? Any REQ treating "valid token" as sufficient?

**PASS (mostly)** — REQ-09 explicitly states a valid JWT alone is NOT
sufficient (role must be admin), so no REQ treats "valid token" as
sufficient on its own. All three cases are represented: admin (implicit
success precondition satisfying both REQ-08+REQ-09), valid-but-non-admin
(REQ-09), no-or-invalid-token (REQ-08). However, per **P1-G02** above, the
"no-or-invalid-token" case is handled as one merged condition rather than
two atomic ones, so the *coverage* is present but not fully atomic.

### 5. Open Questions vs. checklist — what's missing?

- **[P1-G06] real gap** — No Open Question asks whether "no token" and
  "invalid/malformed token" produce the **same or different** denied-access
  response (status code/body). Current OQ-08 only contrasts "no/invalid
  token" (as one bucket) against "valid token + role=user" (401 vs 403); it
  never asks whether "no token" and "invalid token" differ *from each
  other*. This is a direct consequence of P1-G02 — fr11 had an equivalent
  question (OQ-07) that this artifact lacks. Evidence: OQ-08 wording in
  `01_Requirements_Breakdown.md`.
- **[P1-G07] nitpick (partially covered by OQ-01)** — No Open Question asks
  whether the dashboard's own access enforcement (if a separate frontend
  route/guard exists) can be verified independently of the underlying
  `/api/admin/orders` API's access check, given REQ-08/REQ-09 bundle
  "dashboard" and "admin APIs" together (P1-G01). OQ-01 already flags that no
  dedicated dashboard endpoint is confirmed, which partially covers this, but
  does not explicitly raise the dashboard-vs-API enforcement-parity question.
  Evidence: REQ-08/09 wording + OQ-01.

### 6. FR/Observation/Assumption labeling — password mismatch and total_amount contradiction correctly labeled?

**PASS** — REQ-13 (admin password mismatch) and REQ-14 (client-supplied
`total_amount` vs. README FR-08 backend-recompute contradiction) are both
labeled **Observation**, matching the user's explicit instruction 4. No
other REQ appears mislabeled: REQ-01/02/03 (API contract facts) and
REQ-10/11/12 (test setup data) are Observations; REQ-04 through REQ-09 (the
actual MUST-statements from §3.1/3.2/3.3) are Functional Requirements.
Assumptions section states "None identified," and no REQ actually asserts an
unstated business rule as fact — though see P1-G03, which is a citation
defect (wrong/inferred source reference) rather than a mislabeling of the
REQ's own FR/Observation/Assumption tag.

### 7. Does any REQ silently assume "total order count" includes all statuses?

**PASS** — REQ-07 explicitly states "Scope by status is not stated in the FR
— not assumed here; see OQ-02," and OQ-02 correctly leaves the scope
unresolved rather than guessing. No REQ or OQ silently assumes all-statuses
or delivered-only scope.

## Suggested Verdict

**INCOMPLETE.** Two explicitly-flagged merge risks (delivered-inclusion vs.
exclusion; valid-JWT vs. role=admin) were correctly avoided, and item 3/4/6/7
checks pass cleanly. But four real gaps remain: REQ-08/REQ-09 conflate the
dashboard and admin-API access surfaces (P1-G01); REQ-08 conflates "no
token" and "invalid token" into one atomic unit, inconsistent with this
project's own FR-11 precedent (P1-G02); REQ-08's Source Reference cites an
inferred annotation rather than the actual supporting quote, which is in §5,
not §3.3 (P1-G03) — this directly contradicts the artifact's Self-Check
claim of exact quoting; and the resulting Open Questions are missing a
no-token-vs-invalid-token response-parity question (P1-G06). P1-G04, P1-G05,
and P1-G07 are lower-severity nitpicks. Final verdict is yours to decide.

## 2026-07-06 — Phase 2 self-critique (per user checklist)

Re-reading `output/02_Equivalence_Partitioning.md` before approval. Findings
only — nothing fixed yet. Each finding tagged `[P2-Gxx]` with evidence and
an honest severity call (real gap vs. nitpick). No backend source code
exists anywhere in this repository (checked via grep across the repo and
`repomix-output.xml`, which only contains this same coursework project's own
files) — any risk theory cited below is a plausible implementation-pattern
argument, not something verified against actual code, exactly the same
epistemic footing as OQ-05's canceled-order risk flag in the artifact itself.

### Specific check — EC-20 vs. EC-21 field-scope asymmetry

**Answer: yes, this is a real, unrationalized inconsistency. EC-20 should be
split.**

- **[P2-G01] real gap, high severity.** EC-20 ("Dashboard's displayed state
  when zero orders exist at all... covers whatever fields the dashboard
  shows in this case — revenue and/or count") bundles two independently
  verifiable behaviors — the revenue field's zero-display and the order
  count field's zero-display — into one output class. EC-21, covering the
  sibling empty-state precondition (EC-10), does NOT do this: it is scoped
  to revenue only. This is an inconsistent atomicity decision, for four
  reasons:
  1. **REQ-04 (revenue) and REQ-07 (order count) are already separate,
     independently-stated atomic requirements** in the APPROVED Phase 1
     artifact — the exact same kind of "independently stated, so
     independently testable" reasoning that justified keeping access
     control's 3 denial conditions unmerged (§2.1's own rationale: "the FR
     never claims the 3 denial paths produce identical output... collapsing
     them here would hide that question rather than test it"). The same
     logic applies to revenue vs. count: nothing in the FR claims they are
     displayed/computed identically, so they shouldn't be silently bundled
     either.
  2. **EC-20's own REQ/OQ Ref cell cites both REQ-04 and REQ-07 together** —
     the only output-class row in the entire artifact that spans two
     different *display fields*. Contrast EC-21's REQ/OQ Ref, which cites
     REQ-04 + REQ-05 — both about the *same* field (revenue). This is
     internal evidence the row is doing double duty.
  3. **A concrete, plausible risk theory supports the split**: `SUM()` over
     an empty group commonly returns `NULL` in SQL, while `COUNT()` over the
     same empty group correctly returns `0` — a well-known class of bug
     that would make the zero-orders revenue display wrong (null/error)
     while the count display stays correct, or vice versa. This is at least
     as strong a risk signal as OQ-05's canceled-order flag, which was
     sufficient by itself to split EC-06 from EC-07 under guideline (e). No
     backend source exists here to confirm/refute it (see note above), so
     the same conservative posture (split rather than merge) should apply.
  4. **Unlike the EC-19/EC-10 asymmetry** (a count-under-EC-10 companion
     class arguably could be missing too), that gap **is** explicitly
     disclosed and deferred via the artifact's own new OQ-14. EC-20's
     bundling carries no equivalent disclosure — it is presented as a
     settled modeling choice ("OQ-03 asks about the dashboard holistically
     without distinguishing fields") but that rationale conflates "the FR's
     wording doesn't distinguish fields" with "the two fields are one
     behavior," when Phase 1 already established they are two separate
     requirements.
  5. Self-Check bullet 6 states EC-09/EC-10 "each" have "its own output
     twin (EC-20, EC-21)," which reads as claiming clean symmetry — it
     never surfaces that one twin (EC-20) is field-combined while the other
     (EC-21) is field-scoped. Not a false statement, but an incomplete one
     that hid the asymmetry from view.

  Not fixing now, per instruction — but if directed, the fix would split
  EC-20 into a revenue-scoped twin and a count-scoped twin (mirroring
  EC-21's shape), renumbering EC-21 onward.

### General checks

1. **Any other output class silently combining 2+ independently-verifiable
   behaviors?** No other instance found. EC-11..EC-17 are each single,
   field/condition-scoped behaviors. EC-18 and EC-19 each carry multiple
   *open questions* about one single output value (format, precision,
   trustworthiness) — that is not the same defect as combining two
   different *displayed fields*, so they PASS. EC-20 (P2-G01 above) is the
   only real instance.
2. **Does EC-19 still correctly avoid guessing OQ-02's scope?** PASS. EC-19's
   own row states "scope of which orders are counted unresolved — OQ-02"
   directly, and its "Traces From: EC-08" reference is consistent with
   EC-08's own explicit "subset undetermined" caveat (§2.3) — nothing in
   EC-19's wording implies a specific scope (e.g. it never says "count of
   all orders" or "count of delivered orders").
3. **Any input/output class missing a counterpart beyond §4's disclosure?**
   One candidate was checked: a count-specific output companion to EC-21
   (i.e., "order count display under the EC-10 precondition"). This is
   *not* a hidden gap — it is exactly what new OQ-14 already anticipates
   and defers pending OQ-02's resolution. No other missing counterpart was
   found beyond the EC-20 issue already covered under P2-G01.
4. **Terminology/ID consistency.**
   - EC IDs are sequential EC-01..EC-21 with no gaps — PASS.
   - **[P2-G02] nitpick.** Input tables (§2.1–2.4) label their citation
     column "REQ Ref", but several of those rows already cite Open
     Questions too (EC-06 cites OQ-05; EC-08 cites OQ-02; EC-09 cites OQ-03;
     EC-10 cites OQ-04) — the same mixed REQ+OQ content that Output tables
     (§3.1–3.5) correctly label "REQ/OQ Ref". The §2 header should match
     §3's for consistency; this is cosmetic, not a substantive defect.

## Suggested Verdict (Phase 2)

**INCOMPLETE.** One real, non-trivial gap: EC-20 bundles two independently
testable display behaviors (revenue, order count) into a single output
class, inconsistent with how this same artifact split access control and
revenue-membership classes elsewhere, and inconsistent with Phase 1's own
REQ-04/REQ-07 separation — a plausible SUM-vs-COUNT-on-empty-set fault
theory means a bug could pass undetected in one field while a test against
the combined class reports "some assertion failed" without isolating which
(P2-G01). One low-severity nitpick: a column-header labeling inconsistency
between §2 and §3 (P2-G02). Everything else checked (guideline application,
OQ-02 scope neutrality, backward traceability, ID formatting) held up.
Final verdict is yours to decide.

## 2026-07-06 — Phase 3 self-critique (per user checklist)

Re-reading `output/03_Domain_Test_Cases.md` before approval. Findings only —
nothing fixed yet. Each finding tagged `[P3-Gxx]` with evidence and an
honest severity call (real gap vs. nitpick).

### Specific check 1 — TC-01's precondition includes canceled orders; is it
correct that §5 doesn't credit TC-01 for EC-16/EC-17?

**Answer: the crediting decision itself is correct, but it is currently
undocumented — that's a real gap, not a false inconsistency to dismiss.**

- **[P3-G01] real gap, moderate severity.** TC-01's precondition sets up
  one order of *every* status, including `canceled` — and TC-01's own
  Expected Result (b) explicitly says the revenue value "excludes the
  other statuses' amounts," which literally covers the same ground as
  EC-16 (canceled excluded) and EC-17 (pending/confirmed/shipping
  excluded). Yet §5 credits only TC-05 for EC-16 and only TC-06 for EC-17.
  The reason this crediting *is* correct: TC-01's non-delivered orders each
  have only "a nonzero `total_amount`" (not individually distinguishable,
  known values) and all four non-delivered statuses coexist in the same
  request. If TC-01's revenue comes out wrong, there is no way to
  attribute the failure to *which* of the four non-delivered statuses
  leaked into the sum — that is exactly why TC-05/TC-06 exist as separate,
  cleanly single-fault-isolated probes (each with a constant reference
  delivered order and a *known* decoy amount). So TC-01's exclusion
  "coverage" is real but **not isolating** — it is closer to a redundant
  sanity check than evidence about a specific excluded status. **The
  document nowhere states this reasoning.** A reader comparing TC-01's
  expected-result text against §5's matrix would reasonably conclude the
  artifact is internally inconsistent, when the actual issue is a missing
  rationale note, not a wrong crediting decision. Evidence: TC-01 row (§1)
  vs. EC-16/EC-17 rows (§5).

### Specific check 2 — filename verification

**Verified, not just asserted: `Glob` on both
`projects/fr01_account_registration/output/*` and
`projects/fr11_order_history_view/output/*` confirms both use exactly
`03_Domain_Test_Cases.md`.** The artifact's opening note claim is accurate —
no gap.

### Specific check 3 — does TC-08 skipping an order-count assertion create a
Phase 4 coverage risk?

**Mostly correctly justified — not resolving OQ-14/OQ-02 by guessing is the
right call, and the deferral is already flagged at the TC level (TC-08's
row explicitly says a count assertion "may" be needed once OQ-02 resolves,
cross-referenced to OQ-14).** This is not fabricated or silently dropped.

- **[P3-G02] nitpick, low severity.** The deferral note lives only in
  TC-08's own row; there is no explicit "Phase 4 impact" callout tying it
  to boundary-value planning specifically. If OQ-02 later resolves toward
  a restricted (e.g. delivered-only) count scope, Phase 4 would need to
  come back and add a boundary case for "order count under EC-10" that
  doesn't exist yet anywhere. Low severity because the underlying gap is
  already disclosed, just not flagged as a forward Phase-4 dependency in
  so many words.

### General checks

**4. Any EC covered by a TC but with an assertion too vague to be
checkable?**

- **[P3-G03] real gap, moderate-to-high severity.** TC-01(c)'s expected
  result for EC-19 (order count) reads: "reflects however many orders
  match the (currently unresolved) counting scope... record the actual
  value observed rather than assuming a specific scope." This provides
  **no pass/fail criterion at all** — it is an instruction to observe, not
  a testable assertion. Contrast TC-07(a)/(b) and TC-08, which at least
  enumerate the plausible candidate values (`0`/blank/absent-field;
  `0`/empty-undefined) so a tester can check against *something*. TC-01's
  own data setup (1 delivered + 1 each of pending/confirmed/shipping/
  canceled = 5 orders total) makes the two scope-based candidate counts
  directly computable (5 if all-statuses scope; 1 if delivered-only
  scope) — the artifact had the information needed to write a genuinely
  checkable conditional assertion (matching the FR-01 precedent of
  explicit "if X then Y; if Z then W" conditional expected results for
  ambiguous classes) and didn't use it. Evidence: TC-01 row (§1), Expected
  Result (c).
- **[P3-G04] nitpick, low severity.** Related but smaller: TC-02/TC-03's
  status-code assertions ("exact status code/body per OQ-08/OQ-13, to be
  confirmed") don't enumerate candidate codes the way TC-04 does ("401 vs.
  403"), even though OQ-08's own Phase 1 wording already names 401
  (no/invalid token) vs. 403 (valid, non-admin) as the two candidates.
  Inconsistent thoroughness between sibling TCs, not a correctness defect.

**5. Terminology/ID consistency re-check.**

- TC IDs (TC-01..TC-08) and EC IDs (EC-01..EC-22 as referenced) are
  sequential and match Phase 1/2's final, already-fixed numbering (e.g.
  TC-07/TC-08 correctly reference the post-P2-G01-fix EC-20/EC-21/EC-22,
  not the old pre-split numbering) — PASS.
- REQ ID references (REQ-01, REQ-03..REQ-10, REQ-13, REQ-14) all match
  Phase 1's final, already-fixed numbering (e.g. the REQ-08/09/10 3-way
  access-control split) — PASS.
- **[P3-G05] real gap, moderate severity.** OQ-12 ("is `GET
  /api/admin/orders` paginated or limited in any way?") is never
  referenced anywhere in this Phase 3 artifact, despite being directly
  relevant to every TC that aggregates across multiple orders — especially
  TC-01 (5 orders in one data set) and, per new OQ-15's concern about a
  persistent shared test environment, potentially any TC if the system
  accumulates many historical orders over time. If the endpoint silently
  paginates/truncates, TC-01/TC-05/TC-06's expected results could be wrong
  in a live run with no indication why. §6's "carried forward" list also
  omits OQ-12 entirely (and, more trivially, omits OQ-01 from its explicit
  enumeration even though OQ-01 *is* referenced in D-2 — a much smaller,
  cosmetic version of the same "carried-forward list doesn't match what's
  actually referenced" issue).

## Suggested Verdict (Phase 3)

**INCOMPLETE.** Three real gaps: TC-01's exclusion-adjacent assertion
overlaps EC-16/EC-17 without the document explaining why it isn't credited
for them, which is defensible reasoning left unstated (P3-G01); TC-01(c)'s
order-count expected result has no checkable pass/fail criterion at all,
unlike its sibling TCs which at least enumerate candidate values (P3-G03);
and OQ-12 (pagination risk) is never referenced despite being directly
relevant to every multi-order TC (P3-G05). Two low-severity nitpicks: a
missing explicit Phase-4-impact callout on TC-08's deferral (P3-G02), and
inconsistent candidate-code enumeration between TC-02/03 and TC-04 (P3-G04).
Filename verification (specific check 2) and ID/REQ numbering consistency
both passed cleanly. Final verdict is yours to decide.

## 2026-07-06 — Phase 4 self-critique (per user checklist)

Re-reading `output/04_Boundary_Value_Test_Cases.md` before approval.
Findings only — nothing fixed yet. Each finding tagged `[P4-Gxx]` with
evidence and an honest severity call.

### Specific check 1 — is OQ-16 missing intentional or an error?

**Answer: a plain numbering error, not a documented exclusion — no record
anywhere of an OQ-16 having been considered and dropped.**

- **[P4-G01] real gap, moderate severity.** Phase 3 ended at OQ-15. This
  artifact's new-OQ table (§5) jumps straight to OQ-17, OQ-18, OQ-19 with no
  OQ-16 anywhere and no explanation for the skip. There is no rationale in
  the document (or in how the questions were derived) that would justify a
  deliberate gap — it is a plain sequential numbering slip. Fix expectation
  per the user: renumber to close the gap (OQ-17→OQ-16, OQ-18→OQ-17,
  OQ-19→OQ-18) rather than retroactively inventing a placeholder OQ-16.
  Evidence: §5 "New in Phase 4" table.

### Specific check 2 — does domain (b)'s table silently assume one OQ-02 outcome?

**Answer: yes, this is a real, inadequately-hedged ambiguity, not already
covered elsewhere.**

- **[P4-G02] real gap, moderate-to-high severity.** §0/§2 frame "count of
  `delivered` orders" as feeding "the total order count too... if OQ-02
  resolves toward a delivered-only scope" — but only address *that one*
  resolution. Under the **other** plausible OQ-02 resolution (count = all
  orders regardless of status), EC-10 (orders exist, zero `delivered`) does
  **not** correspond to "total order count = 0" at all — under that scope,
  total count would be however many non-delivered orders exist (nonzero,
  since EC-10 requires at least one order of any status). Only EC-09 (zero
  orders at all, TC-07) would give total-count = 0 under an all-statuses
  scope. The document's own §2 table maps `min = 0` to EC-10/TC-08
  unconditionally, without ever stating that this mapping is correct **only**
  for "count of `delivered` orders" specifically (which is unambiguous
  regardless of OQ-02) and is **not** a valid stand-in for "total order
  count"'s own zero-boundary under every possible OQ-02 resolution. This
  conflates two claims — "delivered-count = 0 ⇒ EC-10" (always true) and
  "total-count = 0 ⇒ EC-10" (true only if OQ-02 resolves delivered-only) —
  under one table row. **Not already hedged elsewhere**: the one Open
  Question that speaks directly to this (OQ-14, from Phase 2/3, about
  whether order count needs its own dedicated empty-state twin depending on
  OQ-02) is never carried forward into this document at all — see P4-G05.
  (BVA-06 itself is unaffected: with only `delivered` orders in that data
  set and no decoys, delivered-count and total-count coincide at `3` under
  either OQ-02 resolution, so the ambiguity doesn't corrupt that specific
  test case — only the `min = 0` boundary claim in §2's table.)

### General checks

**3. Is BVA-06's choice of exactly 3 (vs. minimum-sufficient 2) justified?**

- **[P4-G03] real gap, low-to-moderate severity.** Never justified anywhere
  in the artifact. A legitimate rationale exists and was simply not written
  down: N=2 could pass by coincidence against an implementation hard-bounded
  to "process up to 2 rows" (an off-by-one loop-bound bug), which N=2 alone
  cannot distinguish from correct N-row aggregation; N=3 is needed to rule
  that out. As written, a reader cannot tell whether 3 was a deliberate
  choice or an arbitrary one.

**4. Any BVA case whose expected result is unfalsifiable/too vague to grade?**

- **[P4-G04] real gap, moderate severity.** BVA-02's expected result reads:
  "Displayed revenue reflects `0` from this order **without being
  indistinguishable** from the *no-delivered-orders* empty state... new
  OQ-19 flags whether the dashboard needs to (or even can) distinguish...
  at all; not resolved here." This conflates a genuinely checkable
  assertion (revenue displays `0` for this specific order) with an
  explicitly unresolved question (distinguishability, OQ-19) in one
  sentence that reads as if it asserts a requirement ("without being
  indistinguishable") the same sentence then says is unresolved. As
  written, it is unclear what a tester should actually grade pass/fail on.
  Other BVA rows (01, 03, 04, 05, 06) state a clear, single checkable
  expected value with any open dependency noted *separately*, not fused
  into the same clause — BVA-02 is the one exception.

**5. Terminology/ID consistency re-check.**

- BVA IDs (BVA-01..BVA-06) are sequential, no gaps — PASS.
- EC/REQ/TC cross-references throughout §1/§2 match Phase 1/2/3's final,
  already-fixed numbering (e.g. EC-20/21/22 post-P2-G01-split, REQ-08/09/10
  post-P1-G02-split) — PASS, no stale references found.
- **[P4-G05] real gap, low-to-moderate severity.** §5's "carried forward"
  Open Questions table lists only OQ-09, OQ-07, OQ-06, OQ-02, OQ-12 —
  omitting **OQ-14** and **OQ-15** (both raised in Phase 2/3) even though
  both are relevant to content this Phase 4 document actually discusses:
  OQ-14 bears directly on the exact ambiguity in P4-G02 (order count's
  empty-state twin depending on OQ-02); OQ-15 bears on whether TC-07's
  "zero orders at all" precondition — referenced in §2's table as "TC-07's
  stronger... edge" — is even achievable in a persistent test environment.
  Neither OQ-14 nor OQ-15 appears anywhere else in the document either.

## Suggested Verdict (Phase 4)

**INCOMPLETE.** Five real gaps, all fixable without touching the core
design: a plain OQ-16 numbering skip with no documented cause (P4-G01); a
substantive, inadequately-hedged conflation between "count of `delivered`
orders" and "total order count" at the `min = 0` boundary specifically,
which only holds under one of two plausible OQ-02 resolutions (P4-G02); an
unstated rationale for BVA-06's N=3 choice (P4-G03); a confusingly-worded,
effectively ungradable expected result on BVA-02 (P4-G04); and two relevant
carried-forward Open Questions (OQ-14, OQ-15) silently dropped from §5
(P4-G05, which also weakens P4-G02 since OQ-14 would have been the natural
place to hedge that exact ambiguity). The Self-Check section did not catch
any of these — it verified BVA ID continuity but never checked OQ ID
continuity, and ticked "no Open Question was resolved or guessed" without
checking that all *relevant carried-forward* Open Questions were actually
still present. Final verdict is yours to decide.
