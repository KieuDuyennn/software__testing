# FR-13: Admin Dashboard — Requirements Breakdown (Phase 1)

Source: `input/Functional_Requirement.md` (FR-13: Admin Dashboard, Pool C — Web
Admin), cross-checked against `api_specification.md` §6.2. Access control is
governed by FR-12 (admin-only), referenced but not re-specified here.

## 0. Global Precondition (not repeated per requirement)

REQ-04 through REQ-07 (dashboard content: revenue and order count) describe
what the dashboard shows *once access is granted*. They implicitly assume the
actor already satisfies REQ-08, REQ-09, and REQ-10 (valid JWT, not one that's
missing or invalid, carrying `role = 'admin'`). REQ-08, REQ-09, and REQ-10
themselves cover the access-control rule, including its failure conditions, as
separate atomic requirements. This precondition is stated once here and is not
restated in each content REQ row.

**Terminology note — "dashboard" surface scope (fixes P1-G01):** REQ-08,
REQ-09, and REQ-10 below say access control applies to "dashboard data."
Per OQ-01, no dedicated dashboard endpoint/route is confirmed to exist
separately from the admin order API — the only surface confirmed today is
`GET /api/admin/orders`. These three requirements should NOT be read as
asserting two independently-behaving surfaces (a frontend dashboard route
*and* a backend API) that are proven to enforce access identically. If a
distinct frontend dashboard route is later found to exist, its access control
must be verified against these same rules independently — compliance is not
assumed to carry over from the API by extension.

## 1. Feature Areas

| Area ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AREA-01 | API Contract | Endpoint paths and base URL referenced by FR-13 (admin order data source, status update, base URL) |
| AREA-02 | Revenue Calculation | Total revenue display, its inclusion rule (delivered), and its exclusion rule (all other statuses) |
| AREA-03 | Order Count Display | Total number of orders shown on the dashboard |
| AREA-04 | Access Control | The no-token-denied rule, the invalid-token-denied rule, and the role-must-be-admin rule (per FR-12) |
| AREA-05 | Test Setup Data | Seed accounts and helper endpoints used to produce dashboard test state (not FR-13 behavior itself) |
| AREA-06 | Documentation Discrepancies | Cross-source inconsistencies noticed while reading the input (password mismatch; total_amount trust) — flagged as Observations, not requirements |

## 2. Atomic Requirements

| REQ ID | Area | Statement | Source Reference | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-01 | AREA-01 | The admin order data source is `GET /api/admin/orders` (requires admin JWT). | §2 "Admin order data source: `GET /api/admin/orders` (requires admin JWT)." | Observation |
| REQ-02 | AREA-01 | Order status is updated via `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status` with body `{ "status": "confirmed" }`, allowed values: pending / confirmed / shipping / delivered / canceled. Kept as one Observation row (not split into 3 sub-facts) — Observation-tier, not an FR-13 testable business rule requiring separate atomic tracing; low risk if untangled later in Phase 2. | §2 "Order status update: `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status`..." | Observation |
| REQ-03 | AREA-01 | The base URL for these endpoints is `http://localhost:3000`. | §2 "Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`." | Observation |
| REQ-04 | AREA-02 | The dashboard MUST display total revenue. | §3.1 "The dashboard MUST display **total revenue**." | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-05 | AREA-02 | Total revenue MUST be computed as the sum of `total_amount` of orders whose `status = 'delivered'`. | §3.1 "Total revenue MUST be computed as the **sum of `total_amount` of orders whose `status = 'delivered'`** — and ONLY those orders." | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-06 | AREA-02 | Orders whose status is `pending`, `confirmed`, `shipping`, or `canceled` MUST NOT contribute to total revenue. | §3.1 "Orders in any other status (`pending`, `confirmed`, `shipping`, `canceled`) MUST NOT contribute to total revenue." | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-07 | AREA-03 | The dashboard MUST display the total number of orders. Scope by status is not stated in the FR — not assumed here; see OQ-02. | §3.2 "The dashboard MUST display the **total number of orders**." | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-08 | AREA-04 | If no token is provided when accessing dashboard data, the request MUST be denied (dashboard = whatever surface serves this data; see Global Precondition terminology note — currently only confirmed to be the admin API, per OQ-01). | §5 "No token / invalid token: access denied." (no-token clause) | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-09 | AREA-04 | If an invalid/malformed token is provided when accessing dashboard data, the request MUST be denied (same surface-scope note as REQ-08). | §5 "No token / invalid token: access denied." (invalid-token clause) | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-10 | AREA-04 | A valid JWT alone is NOT sufficient for access to dashboard data (same surface-scope note as REQ-08); the token MUST carry `role = 'admin'`. | §3.3 "A valid JWT alone is not sufficient; the token MUST carry `role = 'admin'`." | Functional Requirement |
| REQ-11 | AREA-05 | Seeded admin account is `admin@eshop.com`, used as the admin actor for dashboard-access tests. | §6 "Seeded admin: `admin@eshop.com` — the admin actor..." | Observation |
| REQ-12 | AREA-05 | Seeded normal user account is `test@eshop.com` / `Test1234!`, used as the non-admin actor for access-denied tests. | §6 "Seeded normal user: `test@eshop.com` / `Test1234!` — the non-admin actor for the access-denied tests." | Observation |
| REQ-13 | AREA-05 | To exercise revenue, orders are created and moved through statuses via `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status` so that only `delivered` orders can be verified to sum into revenue. | §6 "To exercise revenue: create orders and move them through statuses via `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status`..." | Observation |
| REQ-14 | AREA-06 | The seeded admin account's password is inconsistent between sources: README states `Admin123!`, setup_guide states `admin123` — both should be tried and the inconsistency recorded. | §6 "...README lists password `Admin123!`, setup_guide lists `admin123`; try both, record the inconsistency." | Observation |
| REQ-15 | AREA-06 | `api_specification.md` §4.3 allows the client to supply `total_amount` at checkout, which contradicts README FR-08 (backend MUST recompute total_amount). Note (analysis, not part of the quoted contradiction — kept separate per P1-G04): this means the value summed into revenue via REQ-05 may rest on a client-controlled number rather than a backend-verified one; flagged for verification during execution, see OQ-06. | §7 "`total_amount` trustworthiness — api_spec section 4.3 lets the client supply `total_amount` at checkout, contradicting README FR-08..." | Observation |

## 3. Assumptions

None identified. Per session rules, ambiguous or unstated behavior is recorded
under Open Questions (Section 4) instead of being assumed.

## 4. Open Questions

OQ-01 through OQ-09 are taken directly from §7 of the input ("Not Specified in
the FR") — none of these are answered or guessed here. OQ-10 through OQ-13 are
additional gaps identified during decomposition, each with supporting evidence.

| ID | Question | Why It Matters | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OQ-01 | Does a dedicated dashboard endpoint (e.g. `/api/admin/dashboard` or `/api/admin/stats`) exist, or are the metrics computed client-side from `GET /api/admin/orders`? | Determines whether Phase 3/4 test cases hit a dashboard-specific endpoint or must derive revenue/count from the raw orders list; must be verified against the running backend before any API-level test case is written. | §2 Note; §7 bullet 1 |
| OQ-02 | Is "total number of orders" (REQ-07) a count of ALL orders regardless of status, or only some subset? §3.2 does not qualify by status; §5 implies non-delivered orders "may still count," but this is not stated definitively. | Directly determines the expected value asserted in every order-count test case; cannot be designed without this answer. Per special instruction, logged here rather than assumed. | §3.2; §5; §7 bullet 2 |
| OQ-03 | What does the dashboard show when there are zero orders at all (0? blank? absent field?)? | Needed to define the empty-state equivalence class/expected output in Phase 2/3. | §7 bullet 3 |
| OQ-04 | What does total revenue show when there are orders but zero `delivered` orders — `0`, or empty/undefined? | Needed to distinguish "no orders at all" from "orders exist but none delivered" as separate equivalence classes. | §7 bullet 4 |
| OQ-05 | For a `canceled` order (which still has a `total_amount`): is exclusion from revenue (per REQ-06) confirmed in the running implementation, and does a canceled order count toward "total number of orders" (REQ-07)? | REQ-06 states canceled orders must not count toward revenue, but whether they count toward the order-count total is unresolved (ties to OQ-02) and worth an explicit check since a canceled order is the one case with a nonzero `total_amount` that must NOT appear in the revenue sum. | §7 bullet 5 |
| OQ-06 | Given REQ-15 (client-supplied `total_amount` vs. README FR-08 backend recompute), is the revenue sum in REQ-05 actually built on a backend-verified `total_amount`, or can it be manipulated via a tampered checkout request? | Determines whether a tampered-`total_amount` scenario should be included as a test case beyond straightforward equivalence partitioning — a correctness/security concern flagged as an Observation (REQ-15), not yet a confirmed bug. | §7 bullet 6; REQ-15 |
| OQ-07 | What currency, rounding, and number format is used for the displayed revenue? | Needed to define valid-output equivalence classes and precision expectations for the revenue field in Phase 2. | §7 bullet 7 |
| OQ-08 | What is the denied-access response shape — HTTP 401 (no/invalid token) vs. 403 (valid token but `role = 'user'`)? §5 only says "access denied" without a status code. | Determines the expected HTTP status code to assert in the access-denial test cases (REQ-08, REQ-09, REQ-10). | §7 bullet 8 |
| OQ-09 | Is `total_amount` an integer (VND, no decimals) or a decimal value? | Affects whether BVA on the revenue sum in Phase 4 needs a boundary step of 1 or of 0.01. | §7 bullet 9 |
| OQ-10 | What HTTP status code indicates a successful dashboard/orders fetch for an authorized admin? | Not stated anywhere in the input; needed for concrete expected-result assertions on the success path in Phase 3/4. | §2, §5 (success-path content is described but no status code is given) |
| OQ-11 | What is the exact response body shape for the dashboard metrics (e.g., field names/casing such as `totalRevenue`/`total_revenue`, wrapped object vs. flat fields)? | Needed to write concrete expected-output assertions in Phase 3/4; without a sample body, only the underlying values (not the structure) can be verified. | §3.1, §3.2 (field content described, no sample JSON given) |
| OQ-12 | If dashboard metrics are computed client-side from `GET /api/admin/orders` (per OQ-01), is that endpoint paginated or limited in any way? | An unstated pagination limit on the orders list would silently truncate the data set that revenue/count are computed from, producing an incorrect aggregate — a genuine correctness risk worth checking before trusting any expected value derived from that endpoint. | §2 (no pagination information given for `GET /api/admin/orders`) |
| OQ-13 | For access denial due to missing/invalid credentials, does "no token" (REQ-08) produce the same denied-access response (status code/body) as "invalid/malformed token" (REQ-09), or a different one? | REQ-08 and REQ-09 are now split as separate atomic conditions (Phase 1 self-critique finding P1-G02); this asks whether their *outputs* also differ, not just whether both result in denial — analogous to FR-11's OQ-07. | New gap identified in Phase 1 self-critique (P1-G02/P1-G06); no §7 bullet covers this directly (§7 bullet 8, now OQ-08, covers role-based denial shape, not the no-token-vs-invalid-token distinction) |

## 5. Self-Check

Re-run after the 2026-07-06 Phase 1 self-critique fixes (P1-G01, P1-G02,
P1-G03, P1-G04, P1-G06 applied; P1-G05 addressed with a kept-as-is
justification). Re-verified line by line, not just re-ticked.

- [x] Every atomic requirement is traceable to the source Functional
      Requirement, and **every REQ's Source Reference is now a direct
      quote of the cited section** — re-checked individually: REQ-01/02/03
      → §2; REQ-04/05/06 → §3.1; REQ-07 → §3.2; REQ-08/09 → §5 "No token /
      invalid token: access denied." (split into its no-token and
      invalid-token clauses); REQ-10 → §3.3 second bullet; REQ-11/12/13 →
      §6; REQ-14 → §6; REQ-15 → §7. This fixes P1-G03: REQ-08 previously
      cited §3.3 with an inferred "(JWT-presence clause, per FR-12)"
      annotation that was not an actual quote — it now cites the real
      supporting text in §5.
- [x] No invented business rules or assumptions presented as fact — nothing
      beyond the FR's text is stated as a REQ; all gaps are in Open
      Questions (OQ-01..OQ-13), and Section 3 (Assumptions) explicitly
      contains none. REQ-15's analytical bridge is now explicitly labeled
      "Note (analysis...)" and separated from the quoted fact, so it can no
      longer be misread as part of the quoted contradiction itself
      (fixes P1-G04).
- [ ] Every equivalence class has at least one covering test case — N/A for
      Phase 1 (equivalence classes and test cases are produced in
      Phase 2/3).
- [x] IDs are unique and consistently formatted (`REQ-01`..`REQ-15`,
      `OQ-01`..`OQ-13`, `AREA-01`..`AREA-06`), zero-padded. The REQ-08 split
      added one ID, shifting former REQ-09..REQ-14 to REQ-10..REQ-15; every
      cross-reference to a shifted REQ ID (Global Precondition §0, OQ-06,
      OQ-08) was checked and updated — no stale REQ number remains.
- [x] No table cell is empty without an explicit marker — all cells
      populated (Assumptions section explicitly states "None identified").
- [x] Terminology is consistent throughout (consistently uses "endpoint"
      for API routes, "order" for the resource, "status" for the enum
      field, "requirement" for REQ rows).
- [x] Each REQ states one independently-testable rule. Revenue: REQ-04
      (display) / REQ-05 (inclusion) / REQ-06 (exclusion). Access control
      is now split three ways instead of two: REQ-08 (no token → denied) /
      REQ-09 (invalid token → denied) / REQ-10 (role must be admin) — this
      fixes P1-G02 (no-token and invalid-token were previously one merged
      REQ-08, unlike the FR-11 REQ-16/REQ-17 precedent). **Caveat, honestly
      disclosed rather than hidden:** REQ-08/09/10 still describe a single
      "dashboard" access surface rather than two independently-tested
      surfaces (frontend dashboard vs. admin API) — this is not fully
      resolved, because OQ-01 has not confirmed a second surface exists to
      split against. Per P1-G01's fix, the Global Precondition section (§0)
      now states explicitly that "dashboard" here means "whatever surface
      serves this data, currently only the admin API" so the requirement
      does not silently assume two surfaces behave identically — but if a
      distinct frontend route is later confirmed, REQ-08/09/10 will need a
      further split at that time. This is a scoped, not a fabricated,
      resolution.
- [x] REQ-02 (three bundled facts: endpoint path, body shape, status enum)
      was reviewed per P1-G05 and kept as one row, with an inline
      justification added to its Statement cell (Observation-tier, not an
      FR-13 testable rule, low risk) rather than split — an explicit
      decision, not an oversight.
